> **Paper Review**: *Trading off Relevance and Revenue in the Jobs Marketplace: Estimation, Optimization and Auction Design*

## The Problem
When a job seeker searches on LinkedIn, the platform displays a ranked list of job postings. This paper focuses on the allocation stage, where the ranking must trade off short-term monetization against long-term marketplace health. The authors introduce two methods to improve relevance while preserving revenue: integrating seeker preference signals into the auction score and using position-aware auctions to better optimize multi-slot assignments.

## Background
When ranking job postings, focusing only on revenue means prioritizing promoted jobs with higher bids, which can lead to less relevant positions being shown to seekers. Over time, this hurts user satisfaction and engagement. On the other hand, ranking purely by match quality ignores monetization and can reduce platform revenue. The core challenge this paper tackles is how to balance these two goals — short-term revenue and long-term user satisfaction — since both are essential for a healthy marketplace.
