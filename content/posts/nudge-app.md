## What is Nudge?

Nudge is a spaced repetition study reminder that helps you maintain and improve your knowledge on any topic through scientifically-proven review intervals. Instead of forgetting what you've learned, Nudge reminds you exactly when to review it for optimal retention and mastery.

## Why I Built This

We all know the feeling: you spend hours learning something new. Whether it's a Leetcode question, a language, or a technical skill—only to forget it weeks later when you actually need it. Traditional note-taking apps help you store information, but they don't help you remember it. That's where spaced repetition comes in.

This was a very personal pain point for me. I was constantly losing track of what I'd learned and needed a simple way to stay on top of my knowledge. So over a weekend, I built Nudge using vibe coding. It's primarily for my own use, but I'm sharing it in case others find it helpful too.

Nudge applies the science of spaced repetition to your everyday learning. By scheduling reviews at optimal intervals, it ensures that what you learn actually sticks in your long-term memory.

## Key Features

- **Smart Review Scheduling**: Uses spaced repetition algorithms to determine the optimal time for your next review
- **Topic Organization**: Keep your learning materials organized by subject or project
- **Timely Reminders**: Get notified when it's time to review, so you never miss the optimal learning window
